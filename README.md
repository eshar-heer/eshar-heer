## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a dedicated software engineering apprentice at Queen Mary University, honing my skills in coding and development while contributing to real-world projects. Outside of tech, Iâ€™m passionate about basketball, where I channel my teamwork and strategic thinking on the court. Balancing both fields keeps me motivated and driven.
